% This code symbolically verifies the derived observability condition in the paper (Condition Eq. 36). 
% The analyirical derivation can be found in Appendix A of the paper.

% The code was used in the paper:

syms s u1 v1 u2 v2 gam

v1v = [u1;v1];
v2v = [u2;v2];

Rm = [cos(gam), -sin(gam);
    sin(gam), cos(gam)];
dRm = diff(Rm,gam);

% So in the paper the second part of equation 33 is:
% 2*v1^T*dRm*(v2v*v1v^T-v2v*v2v^T*Rm^T)
% if we consider no accelerations, then we simply need to show that
% this part somehow is equal to 0 for v1v = s*R*v2v to show unobservability
% (note that we should actually show it is equal to k*pv^T, but choose k=0 here
% since we are free to choose k)
% so let's split it in two parts
% First handle the 2*v1v^T*dRm part, and substitute v1v = s*Rm*v2v
a = 2*(s*Rm*v2v).'*dRm;

% Then do the (v2v*v1v^T-v2v*v2v^T*Rm^T) part with v1v = s*Rm*v2v
b = v2v*(s*Rm*v2v)'-v2v*v2v.'*Rm';

% Then in the end we want to know if a*b = 0, so let matlab do the
% simplification, and output will be equal to [0,0], thus showing it is
% indeed unobservable
output = simplify(a*b)
